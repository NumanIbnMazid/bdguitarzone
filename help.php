						<ul>
							<li class="subitem1"><p>BDguitarZone is an authorized dealer for all brands we carry on our site and all brand new items come with a manufacturers' warranty. You have 2 options should your instruments need warranty repairs covered by the manufacturer:

							Use a local repair shop for warranty services
							Visit our stores to arrange for warranty services facilitated through our network of repair facilities.

							Send it to us for warranty services
							For band and orchestra instruments you have purchased, you also have the option to send the instrument to BDguitarZone and we will take care of the warranty repairs. You are responsible for shipping charges to and from BDguitarZone. We recommend that you insure your package as well. Please be aware that your repair could be delayed if we have to send it back to the manufacturer for warranty service. Please contact Customer Service for instructions.
