Description
The DR-212 is a true 12-string acoustic guitar with the big sound and fine engineering you expect from Epiphone. The DR-212 is not just a dreadnought with 6 extra strings. We designed the DR-212 to take the stress of extra strings and not just support the Spruce top but provide the proper bracing so what you hear is a balanced, cutting, and attention-getting tone. The 12-string dreadnought has often been thought of as the classic-go to guitar for blues, folk, rock, country, and everything in-between.

Description
The OB1 is a combination of great connections and strong buying power! The fact that we can offer a quality violin that will last for years WITH an advancing level outfit, is truly AMAZING. You'll find this level violin for $300-$600 at other violin shops, and that is WITHOUT a quality outfit. The violin will arrive ready to play out of the box. It's a teacher's dream!
